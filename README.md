## Driftrock Developer Test

• Overview
The test is based around producing an app that can answer some questions about data held in a
public API. The API and the questions are detailed below. A lot of the work we do at Driftrock
involves the creation of APIs and communicating with both these internally created APIs and
externally managed ones. Doing this test will involve having to work out how best to merge data
returned from two different end points.

• What you have:
You have been given access to a JSON API on https://driftrock-dev-test.herokuapp.com There are
2 endpoints, 1 for user data (/users) and another for purchase (/purchases) data. More
information can be found in the documentation here http://docs.driftrockdevtest.apiary.io/#.


## Let's get started!

### User stories
From the specs communicated, I have decided to comply with some user stories that would cover the requirements of the script, as follows:

```
As a user,
so that I can see the most sold item for all purchases,
I want to be able to run a command through my terminal

As a user,
so that I can see the total spent for a specific user email,
I want to be able to run a command through my terminal

As a user,
so that I can see the most loyal user,
I want to be able to run a command through my terminal

```
